 Implementing a convolutional neural network (CNN) in PyTorch to classify digits from the MNIST dataset.
 Key steps include importing libraries, preprocessing data, building a CNN with two layers, training over epochs using CrossEntropyLoss and Adam optimizer, and evaluating the model. 
 The model achieves accuracy on the test dataset, successfully predicting digit labels.
